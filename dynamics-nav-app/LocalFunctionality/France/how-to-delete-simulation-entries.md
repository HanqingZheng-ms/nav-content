# How to: Delete Simulation Entries
You can create and post simulation entries to the general ledger without affecting the real accounting, and you can delete the simulated entries.  

## To delete simulation entries  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Simulation Registers**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  Select the simulation register that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.  

This deletes the register entry and the general ledger entries that are linked to it. A dialog box appears in which you must choose the **Yes**  button to confirm.
