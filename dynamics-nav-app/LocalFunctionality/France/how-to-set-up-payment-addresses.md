# How to: Set Up Payment Addresses
To use payment management, you must set up payment addresses that will be used for vendors and customers at the time of settlement. The payment address can differ from the default address.  

The following procedure describes how to set up a payment address for a vendor, but the same steps apply to setting up a payment address for a customer.  

## To set up a payment address  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  Select a vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3.  Choose the **Payment Addresses** action.  
4.  Fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The payment address code.|  
    |**Default Value**|Select to use this address as the default payment address. You can select one default payment address.|  
    |**Name**|The name associated with the payment address.|  
    |**Address**|The payment address.|  

    5.  Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If a payment address is not set up, the address in the vendor or customer card is set as the default value.
