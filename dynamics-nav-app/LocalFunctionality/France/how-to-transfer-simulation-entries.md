# How to: Transfer Simulation Entries
When you have created and posted simulation entries to the general ledger, you can transfer the simulation entries into real accounting entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You transfer simulated entries to the general ledger but create new general journal entries that must be posted manually, and delete the original simulation entries.  

## To transfer simulation entries  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Simulation Registers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the simulation register that you want to transfer, and then choose the **Transfer** action.  
3.  Select the general journal template and general journal batch that you want to transfer the entries to, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4.  In the window that appears, choose the **Yes**  button to confirm the deletion of the simulation entries.  
5.  Open the relevant general journal and post the newly created journal entries.
