# How to: Import CODA Statements
When you receive a CODA statement from your bank, you must import it into [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Bank Accounts for CODA](how-to-set-up-bank-accounts-for-coda.md).  

## To import a CODA statement  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the bank account, and then choose **Import CODA File** action.  
3.  Enter the name of the file to import and then choose the **OK** button.  

This imports the CODA statement. Next, you must process the CODA statement lines. For more information, see [How to: Apply CODA Statements](how-to-apply-coda-statements.md).
