# How to: Set Up Declaration Types
In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)], there are two types of declaration:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, see the [National Bank of Belgium](https://www.nbb.be/) web site.  

When using the extended declaration, you will also need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method.

## To set up declaration types  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** check box to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.
