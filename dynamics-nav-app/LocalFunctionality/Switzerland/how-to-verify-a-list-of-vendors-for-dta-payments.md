# How to: Verify a List of Vendors for DTA Payments
The DatenTrägerAustausch (DTA) payment journal report displays information for each payment line. You can also view comments in the comments column. The report includes information about the number of postings, the highest posting amount, and the total amount in local and foreign currencies.  

## To verify a list of vendors for DTA payments  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
3.  Select the required suggested payment, and then choose the **Print Payment Journal** action.  
4.  In the **DTA Payment Journal** window, on the **Options** FastTab, in the **Layout** field, select one of the following options:  

    - **Amounts** – To print only the payment information.  
    - **Bank** – To print additional bank information for each payment.  

5.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

You can edit or delete the payments in the payment journal. You can print the DTA journal multiple times to verify corrected payments, and then post the payment journal when it is accurate.
