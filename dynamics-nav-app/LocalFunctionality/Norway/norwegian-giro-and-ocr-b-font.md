# Norwegian Giro and OCR-B Font
A General Interbank Recurring Order (giro) is a payment system that operates like a credit transfer.  

The last line on the giro uses the OCR-B font. This is required by Bankenes Betalingssentral (BBS) for use with optical character recognition (OCR) when handling payments from customers. For more information, see the BBS website at [BBS.NO](http://www.nets.eu/no-nb/Pages/default.aspx)  

The OCR-B-10 BT font is generally available from software vendors. In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)], Norwegian sales documents use the OCR-B-10 BT font from BitStream Inc. has been used on the giro. For more information, see the BitStream website at [Bitstream](http://www.bitstream.com/).  

You can use any OCR-B font, but if other fonts are used, the sales documents must be updated by a Microsoft Certified Partner. Contact your partner for more information.
