# How to: Create Manual Remittance Payments
Generally, payments are created automatically in the payment journal using the remittance suggestion function. However, you can also create a payment manually, either as a payment of an existing invoice or as a payment without a link to an existing invoice, such as a payment to a vendor.  

## To create a manual remittance payment  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Info**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Payment Info** window, choose the **Initialize Payment Info** action.  

    If the payment is linked to an existing vendor ledger entry, information will be transferred from the entry. If the payment is not linked to a vendor ledger entry, only partial information will be created.  

3.  Choose the **OK** button.
