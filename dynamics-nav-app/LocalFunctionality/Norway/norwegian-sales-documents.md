# Norwegian Sales Documents
[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)] supports two sets of sales documents. A document set consists of a sales invoice, sales credit memo, reminder, and finance charge memo.  

Set 1 is based on international reports. You cannot print Norwegian giro or use paper sources/trays in this set of reports.  

Set 2 contains reports designed for use in Norway. These reports print Norwegian giro. When printing these reports, you can use paper sources/trays specified in the **Printer Selections** table.  

## Document Set 1  
The first document set consists of standard reports that do not contain any settings specific to Norway. For example, giro transactions are not printed and paper sources/trays cannot be processed.  

Document set 1 contains the following reports:  

- **Sales - Invoice**  
- **Sales - Credit Memo**  
- **Reminder**  
- **Finance Charge Memo**  

## Document Set 2  
The second document set prints Norwegian giro on every page. The giro on the last page contains information about the amount.  

Document set 2 contains the following reports:  

- **Sales - Invoice 2**  
- **Sales - Credit Memo 2**  
- **Reminder 2**  
- **Finance Charge Memo 2**
