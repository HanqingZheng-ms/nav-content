# How to: Apply General Ledger Entries in Closed Periods
[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)] allows you to post entries after a posting period is closed, even if no actual posting is performed during that period. You can also choose the users who will make these entries.  

## To apply an entry in a closed period  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Application always Allowed** check box to apply entries outside the allowed posting period.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  By default, the **Application always Allowed** check box is not selected.  

3.  Choose the **OK** button.  
4.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
5.  In the **User Setup** window, select the **Application always Allowed** check box for each user who can apply entries to a closed period.  
6.  Choose the **OK** button.
