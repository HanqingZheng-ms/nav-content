# How to: Report BAS Information
You need to report the Business Activity Statement (BAS) calculation information for goods and services tax (GST). The **C** and **D** fields on the **Totals** FastTab in the **BAS Calculation Sheet** window are used for fuel tax credits.  

## To report BAS information and calculate the GST settlement  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **BAS Calculation Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **BAS Calculation Sheet** window, choose the **Import** action.  
4.  In the **BAS – Import/Export** window, enter the BAS file name to import a sample XML file. The totals information will be updated. Choose the **OK** button.  
5.  In the **BAS Calculation Sheet** window, choose the **Update** action.  
6.  In the **BAS-Update** window, choose the **Preview** button to view the update information. Choose the **OK** button to close the preview window.  
7.  In the **BAS Calculation Sheet** window, choose the **Export** action.
